Road Improvement Calculator for Open Street Map 
===============================================

This code was developed for the Hackunamatata international development hackday.
It is designed to take a road or region in Open Street Map and a time period,
and calculate how much the quality of these road surfaces has improved.
This is a proxy for infrastructure investment.

Warning
-------

This code is proof of concept; production or even evaulation use may impose
unacceptable and excessive load on Open Street Map servers.
